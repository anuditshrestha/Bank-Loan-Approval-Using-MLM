# Project Title

A machine learning project for predicting bank loan approval decisions based on customer demographic and financial data. This project was developed as lab work for the Data Mining and Data Warehousing course during the 8th semester of my Bachelor's program.

 - Increase accuracy in loan approval decisions
 - Minimize risk of loan defaults
 - Ensure consistent decision-making
## Overview

This project aims to automate the loan eligibility process by predicting whether a loan application should be approved or rejected based on customer information. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, banks can:

Banks receive numerous loan applications daily, and manually processing each application is:

- Time-consuming and resource-intensive
- Prone to human error and bias
- Difficult to scale efficiently

This project develops a predictive model that automatically evaluates loan applications based on applicant data, helping banks identify creditworthy customers while reducing non-performing assets (NPAs).
## Dataset

The dataset contains information about loan applicants with various demographic and financial attributes. Key features include:

- Employment Status
- Education
- Mortgage
- Personal loan
- Securities Account
- Credit Card
## Features

- Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, outliers, and data normalization
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Statistical analysis and visualization of data patterns
- Feature Engineering: Creating new features and transforming existing ones
- Model Training: Multiple ML algorithms for comparison
- Prediction: Real-time loan approval prediction for new applications
